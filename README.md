# The KM Movies

Check out the live [link](https://hands-on-practice.vercel.app/)

This project, the fundamental basics of starting to learn React.js  and the use of full CRUD operations in React are illustrated.

In the collection, a user can view the movies image, released data, a button to add to my movies for the user  and a button to delete the movie from collection.

When a user interacts with the app, it enables them to add their preferedvmovie into the collection by using the form and entering all the details.

Upon Submission, the movie gets added to the collection.
A user can also filter the movies according to name of the movies from A to Z or vice versa 



In the My movies section, a user can remove a movie from their collection  and also delete the movie from the DOM.


Increating the app, I used the **cra** method- ``npx create-react-app hands-on-practice``
