This project, the fundamental basics of starting to learn React.js  and the use of full CRUD operations in React are illustrated.

When a user interacts with the app, it enables them to add their prefered bot into the collection by using the form and entering all the details.

Upon Submission, the bot gets added to the collection.
A user can also filter the bots according to class and sort them according to health, armor, damage and name.

In the collection, a user can view the bot image, bot details, a button to add to army  and a button to delete the bot from collection.

In the My army section, a user can remove a bot from their army  and also delete the bot from the DOM.


Increating the app, I used the **cra** method- ``code-challenge-week2-phase2``
 
## Components Used
1. **App** - Which is the parent compomponent of the app and renders props and data to its children components
